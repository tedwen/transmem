<br>&lt;head&gt;Subject: The staffing in the Commission of the European Communities
<br>&lt;/head&gt;
<br>&lt;p&gt;Can the Commission say:&lt;/p&gt;
<br>&lt;p&gt;1.  how many temporary officials are working at the Commission?&lt;/p&gt;
<br>&lt;p&gt;2.  who they are and what criteria were used in selecting them?&lt;/p&gt;
<br>&lt;p&gt;3.  how many successful candidates from competitions are on reserve lists?&lt;/p&gt;
<br>&lt;p&gt;4.  why, if there are long reserve lists of young people waiting to be offered jobs, so many vacancies are filled with staff on temporary contracts?&lt;/p&gt;
<br>&lt;p&gt;5.  why the candidates on reserve lists are not used as temporary staff?&lt;/p&gt;
<br>&lt;p&gt;6.  what it thinks about the preponderance of Belgian staff in all categories, compared with other nationalities?&lt;/p&gt;
<br>&lt;/div&gt;
<br>&lt;div type="R"&gt;
<br>&lt;head&gt;Answer given by &lt;name type=PERSON&gt;&lt;abbr rend=TAIL-SUPER&gt;Mr&lt;/abbr&gt; Cardoso e Cunha&lt;/name&gt;on behalf of the Commission&lt;date&gt;(22 September 1992)&lt;/date&gt;
<br>&lt;/head&gt;
<br>&lt;p&gt;1 and 2.  The Commission will send tables showing the number of temporary staff working for the Commission directly to the Honourable Member and to Parliament's Secretariat.&lt;/p&gt;
<br>&lt;p&gt;Eligibility criteria for temporary staff are based on the same qualifications as are required of established officials of the same grade and on experience commensurate with the duties the temporary employee will be required to perform. Knowledge and qualifications are assessed on the basis of the qualifications which the applicant submits but also by tests, generally oral ones.&lt;/p&gt;
<br>&lt;p&gt;3.  On 15 January 1992, the reserve lists for the recruitment of established officials included:&lt;/p&gt;
<br>&lt;p&gt;&mdash; 397 names in category A;&lt;/p&gt;
<br>&lt;p&gt;&mdash; 102 names in category LA;&lt;/p&gt;
<br>&lt;p&gt;&mdash; 196 names in category B;&lt;/p&gt;
<br>&lt;p&gt;&mdash; 511 names in category C;&lt;/p&gt;
<br>&lt;p&gt;&mdash; 112 names in category D.&lt;/p&gt;
<br>&lt;p&gt;These figures must be assessed in the light of:&lt;/p&gt;
<br>&lt;p&gt;&mdash; the fact that the reserve lists from the most recent competitive examinations are only just beginning to be put to use;&lt;/p&gt;
<br>&lt;p&gt;&mdash; the obligation under the Staff Regulations to recruit from reserve lists containing, wherever possible, a number of successful candidates at least double the number of posts to be filled;&lt;/p&gt;
<br>&lt;p&gt;&mdash; the normal replacement of officials who leave the Commission every year (retirement, resignation, etc.);&lt;/p&gt;
<br>&lt;p&gt;&mdash; the need to ensure the broadest possible geographic representation.&lt;/p&gt;
<br>&lt;p&gt;4.  The recruitment of persons who have been successful in competitive examinations is not held up by the presence of temporary staff, for temporary staff only rarely occupy permanent posts.&lt;/p&gt;
<br>&lt;p&gt;The great majority of temporary staff occupy temporary posts which cannot be used to recruit permanent officials. Temporary staff are essential for carrying out tasks which are by their nature of limited duration or which require a degree of technical specialization which does not exist among permanent officials, who are &mdash; and must continue to be &mdash; occupied with more general tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
<br>&lt;p&gt;5.  Persons who have passed competitive examinations and are on reserve lists may be recruited only for posts in the establishment plan approved by the budgetary authority. The Commission has obtained only a limited number of posts, insufficient to meet its most urgent operational needs. It was therefore impossible to consider using some of the posts to set up the proposed reserve of employees. However, the Commission, as part of its new recruitment policy, is considering the idea of introducing a group annual recruitment of category A officials commensurate with the foreseeable needs for the year in question.&lt;/p&gt;
<br>&lt;p&gt;6.  The Commission is aware of the geographical imbalance in some staff categories. It is working with the Member States on a variety of operations to promote recruitment of underrepresented nationalities. By the same token, the new guidelines for the recruitment of category A officials which the Commission adopted in June 1991 envisage greater attention being paid to the question of improving the geographical mix.&lt;/p&gt;
<br>&lt;/div&gt;
<br>&lt;/div&gt;
<br>&lt;div type=BODY&gt;
<br>&lt;div type="Q"&gt;
<br>&lt;head&gt;Subject: Supplies of military equipment to Iraq
<br>&lt;/head&gt;
<br>&lt;p&gt;Reports in &lt;q&gt;`The Times'&lt;/q&gt; of 27 September 1991 and &lt;q&gt;`The Sunday Times'&lt;/q&gt; of 28 September 1991 reveal that the 44 United Nations inspectors have identified a number of eastern European companies (and their subsidiaries) which have supplied Iraq with excessive quantities of sophisticated military equipment and, in particular, nuclear technology. Hundreds of &lt;q&gt;`blind'&lt;/q&gt; and self-interested companies throughout the world are involved, many of which are French, British and German, for example H. und H. Metalform of Dreusteinfurt, Matrix-Churchill of Coventry and Hawker Siddeley. As has been reported, the United Nations inspectors were hampered in their work by the Iraqi authorities as soon as they commenced examination of documents from the Iraqi Atomic Energy Commission which had not yet &lt;q&gt;`disappeared'&lt;/q&gt; and only some of which were sent in photography and video form to the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna.&lt;/p&gt;
<br>&lt;p&gt;Can the Council give a complete list of the companies accused of involvement in each of the Member States, indicating the nature of the services they supplied and the way in which they infringed or evaded national laws applying in the Community? It is clear that such laws were inadequate and unsystematically implemented while the consignments to Iraq were taking place; Iraq was already suspect, despite having signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty 20 years ago, and is now 18 months away from joining the &lt;q&gt;`nuclear club'&lt;/q&gt; of powers possessing this arm of mass destruction, together with launchers, rockets or giant howitzers. How was it possible for those laws which were reasonably effective to be flouted and evaded? What legal proceedings will now by initiated against the offenders?&lt;/p&gt;
<br>&lt;/div&gt;
<br>&lt;div type="R"&gt;
<br>&lt;head&gt;Answer &lt;ref n="note1"&gt;(&lt;num&gt;1&lt;/num&gt;)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;date&gt;(1 December 1992)&lt;/date&gt;
<br>&lt;/head&gt;
<br>&lt;p&gt;I can assure the Honourable Member that the Community and its Member States fully share his concern regarding Iraq's non-compliance with its international obligations, namely in the field of nuclear non-proliferation. They played a decisive role in the international efforts which permitted to uncover and render harmless Iraq's weapons of mass destruction as mandated by Security Council Resolution 687. Despite persistent Iraqi deception and obstruction, the inspection missions have exposed incontrovertible evidence that Iraq had a complex and comprehensive nuclear weapons development programme. The IAEA has destroyed key components of that programme. But further questions are still outstanding. Therefore, the Community and its Member States believe it is essential that the international community maintain concerted pressure on Iraq to comply with all relevant UN Resolutions, so that Iraq is never again able to threaten its neighbours.&lt;/p&gt;
<br>&lt;p&gt;The other points referred to by the Honourable Member do not fall within EPC competence.&lt;/p&gt;
<br>&lt;note n="note1"&gt;(&lt;num&gt;1&lt;/num&gt;) This reply has been provided by the Foreign Ministers meeting in Political Cooperation, within whose province the questions came.&lt;/note&gt;
<br>&lt;/div&gt;
<br>&lt;/div&gt;
<br>&lt;div type=BODY&gt;
<br>&lt;div type="Q"&gt;
<br>&lt;head&gt;Subject: Commission plans to liberalize the postal sector and to abolish the State monopoly
<br>&lt;/head&gt;
<br>&lt;p&gt;Having regard to the Commission's intention to issue a Green Paper on the postal sector in the Community;&lt;/p&gt;
<br>&lt;p&gt;Referring to the comments made by Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan, and reported in the press, that he was firmly convinced that the State monopoly in the postal sector needed to be abolished or the sector totally liberalized;&lt;/p&gt;
<br>&lt;p&gt;Bearing in mind the economic and social significance of this sector for the Member States of the Community;&lt;/p&gt;
<br>&lt;p&gt;Whereas the total liberalization of this sector would have an impact on its 1,3 million employees and the range of postal services available in the remote and &lt;q&gt;`economically less viable'&lt;/q&gt; regions of the Community,&lt;/p&gt;
<br>&lt;p&gt;1.  Will the Commission inform us when its Green Paper on the postal sector will be ready and be forwarded to the European Parliament for its opinion?&lt;/p&gt;
<br>&lt;p&gt;2.  Can the Commission confirm that Sir Leon Brittan's remarks about abolishing the State monopoly in the postal sector or totally liberalizing it are identical with the substance of the Green Paper?&lt;/p&gt;
<br>&lt;p&gt;3.  Will the Commission state whether it intends to take measures affecting the postal sector before the European Parliament has delivered its opinion?&lt;/p&gt;
<br>&lt;p&gt;4.  Has the Commission consulted the trade unions and the consumers organizations about the planned measures?&lt;/p&gt;
<br>&lt;p&gt;5.  Does the Commission share the views of the trade unions and the consumer organizations that the abolition of the State monopoly and the privatization of this sector would seriously affect its employees and the range of postal services available in remote and &lt;q&gt;`less-profitable'&lt;/q&gt; regions?&lt;/p&gt;
<br>&lt;/div&gt;
<br>&lt;div type="R"&gt;
<br>&lt;head&gt;Answer given by &lt;name type=PERSON&gt;Sir Leon Brittan&lt;/name&gt;on behalf of the Commission&lt;date&gt;(7 October 1992)&lt;/date&gt;
<br>&lt;/head&gt;
<br>&lt;p&gt;1.  The Green Paper on the creation of a single market for postal services was adopted by the Commission at its meeting of 13 May 1992. When it is published, it will be transmitted to Parliament, whose members will be invited to make known their views during the course of the public consultation period provided for in the Green Paper.&lt;/p&gt;
<br>&lt;p&gt;2.  The Green Paper envisages a situation in which the universal service will be defined and safeguarded, assuring postal users of a good quality service which is accessible and affordable to all. To ensure the viability of the network needed to provide the universal service, it allows for the granting of special and exclusive rights to the providers of the universal service (i.e. the national postal administrations). However, the scope of these reserved services would have to be strictly proportional to the need to maintain a universal service.&lt;/p&gt;
<br>&lt;p&gt;Once the provision of the universal service is guaranteed through the establishment of the reserved area, all other services not falling within the reserved area will be provided in free competition, pursuant to the general rule on the freedom to provide services. These objectives and the public declarations of Sir Leon Brittan, especially on the occasion of the World Express Freight and Distribution Conference in Amsterdam on 4 June 1991, are in accordance with EEC Treaty rules, in particular Articles 59, 86 and 90 &lt;ref n="note1"&gt;(&lt;num&gt;1&lt;/num&gt;)&lt;/ref&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
<br>&lt;p&gt;3.  The Commission's adoption of the Green Paper marked the beginning of a period of consultation with all interested parties. Following these consultations, the Commission will decide what measures are necessary on the basis of the information received. In particular, it is not planning to exercise the powers available to it under Article 90 (3) to adopt general binding measures in the postal sector without holding proper, detailed discussions beforehand with all those concerned.&lt;/p&gt;
<br>&lt;p&gt;However, the foregoing observations are entirely without prejudice to the Commission's duty to adopt, where necessary, decisions implementing Articles 85, 86, 90 &lt;ref n="note2"&gt;(&lt;num&gt;1&lt;/num&gt;)&lt;/ref&gt; and 92 of the EEC Treaty.&lt;/p&gt;
<br>&lt;p&gt;Moreover, as guardian of the Treaty, the Commission ensures compliance with existing Community rules on the free movement of services (Article 59 et seq.), particularly as regards services falling outside the reserved area.&lt;/p&gt;
<br>&lt;p&gt;4.  Before the adoption of the Green Paper, preliminary contacts took place with a number of trade-union and consumer organizations through the Postal, Telegraph and Telephone International (PTTI), Eurofedop, the BEUC and the Consumers Consultative Committee (CCC), among others. These bodies, as well as others also considered to be representative in various fields linked with the postal sector, will be invited to give their formal opinions on the Green Paper during the public consultation procedure following its publication.&lt;/p&gt;
<br>&lt;p&gt;5.  As indicated at 2, the options set out in the Green Paper have as their principal aim to guarantee a good quality universal service which is accessible and affordable to all (including residents of remote regions or areas where the standard of the postal service, as currently provided by the postal authorities, is poor). To achieve this, it is anticipated that Member States will wish to continue granting exclusive rights to their postal administrations in respect of a reserved area. Moreover, these postal administrations are expected to continue to be active participants in the non-reserved areas.&lt;/p&gt;
<br>&lt;p&gt;None the less, the consequences which any proposed changes in the organization of the postal service might have on those employed in the sector is of considerable importance and is one of the areas which will be further evaluated during the public consultation period following publication of the Green Paper.&lt;/p&gt;
<br>&lt;/div&gt;
<br>&lt;/div&gt;
<br>&lt;div type=BODY&gt;
<br>&lt;div type="Q"&gt;
<br>&lt;head&gt;Subject: New industries in Attika
<br>&lt;/head&gt;
<br>&lt;p&gt;The Greek Government is drawing up a draft presidential decree on the establishment of new industries in Attika overlooking the fact that more than 3 500 industries are already operating and polluting the region of Athens and the Thriasian Plain. Does the Commission intend to advise the responsible bodies in Greece on the application of technologies in these new industrial units so that they do not pollute the environment?&lt;/p&gt;
<br>&lt;/div&gt;
<br>&lt;div type="R"&gt;
<br>&lt;head&gt;Answer given by &lt;name type=PERSON&gt;&lt;abbr rend=TAIL-SUPER&gt;Mr&lt;/abbr&gt; Van Miert&lt;/name&gt;on behalf of the Commission&lt;date&gt;(23 September 1992)&lt;/date&gt;
<br>&lt;/head&gt;
<br>&lt;p&gt;Under current Community law, the case referred to by the Honourable Member must be examined with reference to Directives 84/360/EEC (industrial installations), 85/ 337/EEC (impact assessment), 80/779/EEC, 82/884/ EEC and 85/203/EEC (air quality).&lt;/p&gt;
<br>&lt;p&gt;The Commission intends to contact the Greek authorities to find out what measures have been taken or are planned in accordance with these Directives.&lt;/p&gt;
<br>&lt;p&gt;Particular attention will be given to the problem of air pollution and the foreseeable impact of new installations on concentrations of &lt;abbr rend=TAIL-SUB&gt;SO2&lt;/abbr&gt;, dust, Pb and &lt;abbr rend=TAIL-SUB&gt;NO2&lt;/abbr&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
<br>&lt;/div&gt;
<br>&lt;/div&gt;
<br>&lt;/div&gt;
<br>&lt;/div&gt;
<br>&lt;div type=BODY&gt;
<br>&lt;div type="Q"&gt;
<br>&lt;head&gt;Subject: Citizen's rights under Community law
<br>&lt;/head&gt;
<br>&lt;p&gt;What provision is made by the Commission and Member States to meet the needs for information, advice and representation on citizens' rights under Community law?&lt;/p&gt;
<br>&lt;/div&gt;
<br>&lt;div type="R"&gt;
<br>&lt;head&gt;Answer given by &lt;name type=PERSON&gt;&lt;abbr rend=TAIL-SUPER&gt;Mr&lt;/abbr&gt; Dondelinger&lt;/name&gt;on behalf of the Commission&lt;date&gt;(18 September 1992)&lt;/date&gt;
<br>&lt;/head&gt;
<br>&lt;p&gt;The Commission welcomes the interest of the Honourable Member regarding the provision of full information to European citizens on their rights under Community law. As far as the legal framework of this information is concerned the Commission would refer to its answer to the Honourable Member's Written Question No 2733/91 &lt;ref n="note1"&gt;(&lt;num&gt;1&lt;/num&gt;)&lt;/ref&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
<br>&lt;p&gt;The Commission is doing a great deal to inform citizens of their rights under Community law; for example, the creation in 1988 of the Euro-Jus network. This network consists of 12 legal experts (one in each Member State) to whom citizens can put questions, either by phone, letter or directly, concerning Community law (such as free movement of persons, social security, right of establishment, etc. . .), its application to and its consequences for their everyday lives.&lt;/p&gt;
<br>&lt;p&gt;When necessary they can also advise people on how to lodge a complaint with the Commission and explain the procedure when introducing a petition to the European Parliament.&lt;/p&gt;
<br>&lt;p&gt;Euro-Jus is the most direct way of informing citizens, but it is not the only way. The Commission has launched a number of programmes and action plans such as: the People's Europe information handbook and the Symbiosis network. The Commission has also published a series of guides on social security rights for workers who move within the Community.&lt;/p&gt;
<br>&lt;p&gt;Since the beginning of the year the Symbiosis network has entered its concrete phase. A number of consultative meetings have taken place in several Member States with the representatives of the territorial authorities (the network counts over a thousand members at present), which constitutes one of the information relays closest to the citizens and to their everyday life.&lt;/p&gt;
<br>&lt;p&gt;The number of debates taking place in certain Member States concerning the ratification of the Maastricht Treaty, clearly illustrates the necessity to supply citizens with simple precise information, especially when related to European citizenship and to a People's Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
<br>&lt;p&gt;Full information on European citizenship should on the one hand encourage European citizens to use their right to vote, to free movement and to diplomatic protection and, on the other hand, to try to answer questions which some people may have in relation to voting rights in local elections and to the free movement of persons.&lt;/p&gt;
<br>&lt;note n="note1"&gt;(&lt;num&gt;1&lt;/num&gt;) OJ &lt;abbr&gt;Nº&lt;/abbr&gt; C 345, 30. 12. 1992.&lt;/note&gt;
<br>&lt;/div&gt;
<br>&lt;/div&gt;
